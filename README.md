# Introduction

Purpose of this repository is to provide very simple introductory tutorials for energy analytics novices. 

+ Data is preprocessed and cleaned
+ Only scikit-learn models are used.
+ Focused on regression models. Data is actually for forecasting, but we currently do not apply time series models.
+ State-of-the-Art (SotA) approaches are avoided. This is not an ML-Ops repository. Each notebook is an almost-copy of the other, except the model object.
+ Hyperparameter tuning is not covered.
+ Convenient reproducibility is at the center. You only need the input data file and the Jupyter Notebook.

Briefly, this repository covers fundamentals, provides hands on applications (good if you are bored of iris dataset),
