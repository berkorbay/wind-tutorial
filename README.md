# Introduction

Purpose of this repository is to provide very simple introductory tutorials for energy analytics novices. 

+ Data is preprocessed and cleaned ()
+ Only sklearn models are used (currently).
+ State-of-the-Art (SotA) approaches are avoided. This is not an MLOps repository. Each notebook is an almost-copy of the other, except the model object.
+ Hyperparameter tuning is not covered.
+ Convenient reproducibility is at the center. You only need the input data file and the Jupyter Notebook.
